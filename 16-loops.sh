#Loops are used to execute something for certain number of times


# There are 2 major types of loops ; 
#     1) For loop       ( When you know something to be executed n number of time, we use for loop)
#     2) While loop     ( When you don't know something to be executed n number of times, we use while loop)


# For loop syntax 
for val in 10 20 30 40 50 ; do   
    echo "Value for the loop is $val"
done                                                #whenever we use do we use done
